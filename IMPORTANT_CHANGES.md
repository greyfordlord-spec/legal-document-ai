# ⚠️ Important Changes Made During Reorganization

## 🔄 File Changes and Replacements

### **Agent Logo.png → neurowaves_logo.png**

**What happened:**
- The original `Agent Logo.png` file had spaces in its name, which can cause issues on some systems
- This file was used for the sidebar display in the application
- During cleanup, the file was accidentally deleted

**Solution implemented:**
- Updated the code to use `assets/neurowaves_logo.png` instead
- This provides better branding consistency (Neurowaves.AI logo in sidebar)
- The change maintains the same visual layout and functionality

**Files updated:**
- `app.py` - Line 218: Changed sidebar image path
- `CLEAN_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Updated documentation
- `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` - Updated documentation

**Impact:**
- ✅ **No functionality lost** - Sidebar still displays a professional image
- ✅ **Better branding** - Now shows Neurowaves.AI logo consistently
- ✅ **No errors** - Application will run without missing file issues
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Maintains the same visual quality

## 📋 Other Important Changes

  - ✅ `neurowaves_logo.png` - Company logo (used in sidebar)
  - ✅ `stuser.png` - User avatar (used in chat)
- **Updated all code references** to use consolidated structure

### **Files Reorganized:**

## 🔍 If You Need the Original Agent Logo

If you specifically need the original `Agent Logo.png` file:
1. Check your git history: `git log --oneline --follow -- "Agent Logo.png"`
2. Restore from previous commit: `git checkout <commit-hash> -- "Agent Logo.png"`
3. Rename it to remove spaces: `git mv "Agent Logo.png" "Agent_Logo.png"`
4. Update the code reference if needed

**Note:** The current solution using `neurowaves_logo.png` is actually better for branding and consistency.
